<p>The <i>4th International Conference on Applied Category Theory</i> 
will take place at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge
on 12-16 July 2021, preceded by the
Adjoint School 2021 on 5-9 July. This conference follows previous events at
<a href="http://act2020.mit.edu/">MIT</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ACT2019/">Oxford</a>
and
<a href="https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops/">Leiden</a>.</p>

<p>The conference will be a hybrid event, with physical attendees present
in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online. Due to the need for
	physical distancing, the number of in-person registrations will be
	limited, so please don't book your travel or accommodation
	until your registration is confirmed.</p>

<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of
researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using
category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science,
mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition,
and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as
the systems being studied. The goal of Applied Category Theory is to bring
researchers in the field together, disseminate the latest results, and
facilitate further development of the field.</p>
	
<p>We accept contributions across the pure-applied spectrum, from
pure mathematical research, to case studies describing successful
application of category-theoretic tools in industry. However,
submissions at the most mathematical end should take care to explain
how this work could be applied to a subject outside of pure category
theory itself, while submissions at the most applied end should
contain a clear explanation of the category theory involved.</p>

<p>To accommodate the publishing conventions of different fields,
we accept submissions of both original research papers, and also work
	accepted/submitted/published elsewhere. Accepted original
	research papers will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume.
The keynote addresses will be drawn from the best accepted papers. The conference will include an
industry showcase event.</p>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Submission Deadline: Monday 10 May 2021</li>
<li>Author Notification: Monday 7 June 2021</li>
<li>Financial Support Application Deadline: Monday 7 June 2021</li>
<li>Financial Support Notification: Tuesday 8 June 2021</li>

<li>Adjoint School: Monday 5 to Friday 9 July 2021</li>
<li>Main Conference: Monday 12 to Friday 16 July 2021</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Financial Support</h2>
	<p>Some financial support is available to support attendance by junior researchers who would like to attend the conference in person.
To apply for this, send an email to Lukas Heidemann at <a href="mailto:lukas.heidemann@cs.ox.ac.uk">lukas.heidemann@cs.ox.ac.uk</a>
		from an academic email address, with subject line "ACT 2021 Financial Support Application".</p>
	<p>In your email, please give the following
	information: your name and affiliation; an estimate of the total cost for you to attend; the amount you are requesting;
	whether or not you have submitted a paper (and if so, its submission number); whether you have secured or applied for
	partial funding from another source. Also, please give a brief statement about why you believe that COVID restrictions
	will not prevent you from attending (e.g. "I live in the UK, and current government projections indicate no restrictions on
		conference travel and participation in July.")</p>
	<p>You will be informed about the result of your application on Tuesday 8 June. Successful applicants for financial
	support will be able to register for free during the Priority Registration period, which opens on Wednesday 9 June.</p>
	
	<h2>Registration</h2>
	
	<p>All participants, both physical and online, must be registered. Registration for online participation will open soon.</p>
	
	<p>Priority registration for physical participants will open on Wednesday 9 June. In this priority period, registration is restricted
	to speakers, sponsors, and those who have been awarded financial support. Ordinary physical registration opens on Monday 13 June.
	The total number of physical registrations will be restricted to allow for social distancing during the conference.</p>
	
	<h2>Local Information</h2>
	
	<p>The conference will take place physically at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. Information about travel will follow soon.</p>
	
	<p>Accommodation will be available for priority booking by in-person participants at a College of the university.
		The deadline for booking this accomodation is Monday 13 June. Please only book this accommodation if you have
		registered as a physical participant, as registration numbers are limited, due to the need for social distancing.
		The number of available accommodation rooms matches the number of registration slots, so if you have successfully
		registered for physical participation, you are guaranteed to be able to book accomodation, as long as you do so
		before the deadline. In the remote possibility that the physical part of the conference has to be cancelled
		due to COVID, the cost of the accommodation will be fully refunded.</p>
	
	<p>The physical conference will be organized in a COVID-safe way. In particular, participants will be expected to observe
	social distancing, the number of participants will be restricted, seating in the lecture theatre will be well-spaced,
	coffee and lunch breaks will be outdoors where possible, and masks will be required while not eating or drinking.</p>
	
<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Submission will be via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act20210">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act20210</a></p>

<p>Two types of submissions are accepted, both of which will be reviewed
using the same standards:
<ul>
<li> <i>Proceedings Track.</i>  Original contributions of high-quality work
consisting of an extended abstract, up to 12 pages, that provides evidence of
results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the program
committee to assess the merits of the work. Submission of
work-in-progress is encouraged, but it must be more substantial than a
research proposal. Accepted submissions in this track will be invited for publication
	in a proceedings volume.
</li>
<li> <i>Non-Proceedings Track.</i> Submissions presenting high-quality work submitted or
published elsewhere, or for which publication in the proceedings is not desired by
	the authors, may be submitted to this track, provided the work is recent
and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length, but the
program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages of the
submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain sufficient
evidence of the quality and rigour of your work.
</li>
</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
Papers in the two tracks will be reviewed against the same standards
of quality. Since ACT is an interdisciplinary conference, we use two
tracks to accommodate the publishing conventions of different
disciplines. For example, those from a Computer Science background may
prefer the Proceedings Track, while those from a Mathematics, Physics
or other background may prefer the Non-Proceedings Track. However,
authors from any background are free to choose the track that they
prefer, and submissions may be moved from the Proceedings Track to the
		Non-Proceedings Track at any time at the request of the authors.</p>

<p>Contributions must be submitted in PDF format. Submissions to the
Proceedings Track must be prepared with LaTeX, using the EPTCS style
	files available at <a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Programme</h2>

The scientific programme is not yet available.

<h2>Local Information</h2>

To be announced.

<h2>Adjoint School</h2>

<i>Applications for the Adjoint School 2021 are now closed.</i>

<p>The Adjoint School is an annual collaborative research event, in which junior researchers work on cutting-edge
	topics in applied category theory, guided by expert mentors. Traditionally, after a four month reading course,
	the participants meet at the venue of the ACT conference for a week of in-person research collaborator. Due to
	the pandemic, this year the research week will be held online. The students will share the results of their
	research in a special session during the ACT conference.</p>

	<p>For more information see the <a href="http://adjointschool.com">official school website</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Statement of Values</h2>
	
	The organizers hope that the Applied Category Theory community can be a positive force in the world. To help us
	achieve this, we have drafted a <a href="http://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/statement-of-values/">Statement of Values</a>,
	which we ask all participants to uphold.
