<p>The <i>4th International Conference on Applied Category Theory</i> 
will take place at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge
on 12-16 July 2021, preceded by the preceded by the
Adjoint School 2021 on 5-9 July. This conference follows previous events at
<a href="http://act2020.mit.edu/">MIT</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ACT2019/">Oxford</a>
and
<a href="https://www.appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops/">Leiden</a>.</p>

<p>We hope to run the conference as a hybrid event, with
physical attendees present in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online.
However, due to the state of the pandemic, the possibiity of in-person
attendance is not yet confirmed. <b>Please do not book your travel or hotel
accommodation yet.</b></p>

<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of
researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using
category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science,
mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition,
and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as
the systems being studied. The goal of Applied Category Theory is to bring
researchers in the field together, disseminate the latest results, and
facilitate further development of the field.</p>

<p>We accept submissions of both original research papers, and work accepted/submitted/published
elsewhere. Accepted original research papers will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume.
The keynote addresses will be drawn from the best accepted papers. The conference will include a
industry showcase event.</p>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Submission Deadline: mid-May 2021</li>
<li>Author Notification: mid-June 2021</li>
<li>Registration: TBD</li>
<li>Adjoint School: 5-9 July 2021</li>
<li>Main Conference: 12-16 July 2021</li>
</ul>


<h2>Submissions</h2>

<p>Submission will be via EasyChair, and is not yet open.</p>

<p>Two types of submissions are accepted, both of which will be reviewed
using the same standards:
<ul>
<li> <i>Proceedings Track.</i> Original contributions of high-quality work
consisting of a 5–12 page extended abstract that provides evidence of
results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the
program committee to assess the merits of the work. Submission of a
work-in-progress is encouraged, but it must be more substantial than a
research proposal.
</li>
<li> <i>Non-Proceedings Track.</i> Descriptions of high-quality work submitted
or published elsewhere will also be considered, provided the work is
recent and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length,
but the program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages
of the submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain
sufficient evidence of the quality and rigor of your work.
</li>
</ul>
Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in
PDF format.</p>


<h2>Programme</h2>

The scientific programme is not yet available.

<h2>Local Information</h2>

To be announced.

<h2>Sponsorship</h2>

To be announced.

<h2>Adjoint School</h2>

<i>Applications for the Adjoint School 2021 are now closed.</i>
<p>The Adjoint School is an annual week-long collaborative research event, in which junior researchers work on cutting-edge topics in applied category theory, guided by expert mentors. This year, we hope
to run the adjoint school as a hybrid event, with both online and physical participation
possible. More infomration will be made available soon.</p>
